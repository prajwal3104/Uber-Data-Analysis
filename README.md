# Uber-Data-Analysis 
> Python, SQL, GCP, BigQuery, Mage, Looker

+ Set up data pipeline: Juypter Notebook > Mage > BigQuery > Looker for faster analysis.


+ Created fact and dimension table with Python, ensuring that the data was structured and
optimized for analysis.

+ Created a Python script responsible for orchestrating the data pipeline, ensuring a smooth flow
of data from one stage to another.

+ Exported the prepared tables from Mage into Google BigQuery.

+ In BigQuery, we utilized SQL queries to perform data integration by joining the fact and
dimension tables, forming an analytical dataset.

+ Using Looker, designed an interactive dashboard, incorporating data sourced from BigQuery.
